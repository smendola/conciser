# Extension Icons

Create three icon files in this directory:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)

## Quick Option: Use Placeholder

You can use any simple PNG files as placeholders. Even a screenshot resized will work.

## Online Tool

Visit: https://www.favicon-generator.org/
1. Upload any image (or use text)
2. Generate icons
3. Download and rename to icon16.png, icon48.png, icon128.png

## Or skip for now

Chrome will work without icons, just won't look as nice!
